Lettuce Jam 
=======

#### The Github For Musicians

What if musicians could collaborate with each other on the itnernet as easily as software developers do? That was the inspiration behind creating Lettuce Jam. It's an open-source, collaborative platform where musicians can upload their songs (even if they are incomplete).

* Installation:

1. Click on 'Download ZIP' and save the .zip file on your computer. It requires 37.3 MB of storage space.
2. Unzip the file. If you do not have any installed software that can handle .zip files, I recomend [downloading 7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/).
3. Install wordpress.org on your server or your local host (your computer's hard drive). Here are the steps for [making Wordpress run from your computer](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/). 
3. Log into your server's FTP and navigate into the htdocs folder. Upload the entire lettucejam-1-master folder (including all files and sub-folders) to the folder you are in. If you are hosting from your computer, just paste the lettucejam-1-master folder into your htdocs folder.
4. Configure credentials for your website on "your_url"/lettucejam-1-master or localhost/lettucejam-1-master
 
The default credentials are:  
Username: admin |
